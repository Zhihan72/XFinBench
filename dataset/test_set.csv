\[87 \times 0.94988 \times N(-1.11688) - 100 \times 0.85092 \times N(-1.14277) = 0.14\]

Since the underlying bond pays no coupon, put-call parity states that the put price plus the bond price should equal the call price plus the present value of the strike price. The bond price is 85.09, and the present value of the strike price is \(87 \times 0.94988 = 82.64\). Put-call parity is therefore satisfied:
